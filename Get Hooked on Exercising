**Key Points**
Here are some key points to consider when conducting the assessment and planning a program:
1. Initial interview: Begin by conducting an initial interview with the individual to understand their background, previous experiences with running, reasons for wanting to make it a habit, and any specific aversions or challenges they may have encountered.
2. Identify aversion triggers: Explore the specific reasons behind the individual's aversion to running. It could be related to physical discomfort, negative past experiences, psychological barriers, self-doubt, fear of failure, or other factors. Identifying these triggers will help address them effectively.
3. Assess psychological factors: Evaluate the individual's psychological factors related to running. This may include their self-confidence, motivation levels, goal-setting abilities, self-discipline, focus, and resilience. Understanding these factors will guide the development of strategies to enhance their psychological readiness for running.
4. Assess physical factors: Assess the individual's physical fitness level, any pre-existing medical conditions, and potential limitations that may impact their running performance or contribute to their aversion. Consulting with a qualified sports physician or physical therapist can be helpful in this regard.
5. Set realistic goals: Collaboratively establish short-term and long-term goals with the individual. These goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART goals). Breaking down larger goals into smaller milestones can provide a sense of progress and achievement, boosting motivation.
6. Develop a personalized program: Design a personalized running program that gradually increases in intensity and duration. Consider incorporating a mix of running workouts, strength training, flexibility exercises, and cross-training activities to provide variety and reduce monotony. Adapting the program to the individual's preferences and abilities can enhance adherence.
7. Implement behavioral strategies: Introduce behavioral strategies to overcome the aversion and develop a habit of running. This may involve techniques such as positive reinforcement, visualization, self-talk, goal-setting, time management, creating a supportive environment, and utilizing social support networks. These strategies can help change negative associations with running and promote positive habits.
8. Monitor progress and provide feedback: Regularly assess the individual's progress and provide constructive feedback. Monitor their adherence to the program, track performance improvements, and address any setbacks or challenges they may encounter. Adjust the program as needed to ensure it remains engaging and aligned with their evolving needs.
9. Offer ongoing support: Provide ongoing support, encouragement, and guidance throughout the process. Regular check-ins, reassessments, and discussions can help maintain motivation, troubleshoot issues, and ensure continued progress towards making running a habit.
