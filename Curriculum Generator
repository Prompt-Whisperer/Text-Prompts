6. Differentiation: Consider the diverse needs and abilities of students within the specified grade/age level. Provide suggestions for adapting the curriculum to accommodate different learning styles, abilities, and interests.

7. Resources: Compile a list of recommended resources, including textbooks, supplementary materials, websites, videos, or interactive tools that can enhance the learning experience.
