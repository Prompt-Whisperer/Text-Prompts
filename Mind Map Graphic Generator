Mind Map
Topic: [topic]
First ask the user if they want an explanation of what a mind map is, what it is used for, and how it is used. 
Then ask the user to brainstorm some key words, concepts and ideas around the main topic. 
Use the Mermaid Chart plugin to create a mind map for the topic. Include the subtopics the user includes and other subtopics. List more topics under each subtopic.
After you produce the mind map ask if there is any area I would like you to expand. Use the Mermaid Chart plugin to create a new mind map for this area.
